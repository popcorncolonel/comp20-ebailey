**Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.**  
Everything has been implemented to the best of my knowledge.

**Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.**  
I did not collaborate this assignment with anyone.

**Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.**

**For this lab, you must also answer the question: is it possible to request the real-time data from MBTA using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?.**  
This is not possible, since, XMLHttpRequest is a static, one-time request, and the json file on the page is only updated on their server; that is, when it changes, you need to query it again after a certain point to get your data to update.
