1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
The purpose of this repo is to showcase my skills and growth as a web programmer, regarding technical skill, number of APIs used, and careful attention to security.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was the portfolio assignment, as I learned a lot about how front-end development works, an area in which I was uncomfortable.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I feel I am much more of a diligent programmer with regard to security. Before this semester, I took absolutely no heed to potential vulnerabilities, but this has changed.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I believe the most important thing I learned in this class was the client-server model at a very low level, especially regarding the OSI model and how that has been perfected over the years.
Examples:
    -In-class visual explanations were very helpful, especially when we applied it to assignments 2 and 3.
    -Interviewers (Microsoft Azure) have asked about this

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I would have liked to gone into front-end APIs in-class more frequently (I know it is possible to go into this on the final project, but it is not necessary, or could be abstracted away).
